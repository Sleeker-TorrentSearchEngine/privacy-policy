            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Sleeker Cartoons</strong> built the <strong>Sleeker - Torrent Search Engine</strong> app (the "Service"). This Service is provided by <strong>Sleeker Cartoons</strong> and is intended for use as is.</p>
        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our Service.</p>
        <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The information we collect is used solely for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>To provide a better, more reliable experience, we collect certain types of information. This data is essential for functional and analytical purposes to improve app performance and stability.</p>
        
        <p>The information we collect includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> We assign an anonymous, random identifier to your app installation. This ID is not linked to your personal identity. <strong>Benefit:</strong> It helps us diagnose and fix app crashes and technical issues. If your app encounters an error, this ID allows us to identify the problem log and improve app stability for everyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate Location Data:</strong> We collect approximate location information. <strong>Benefit:</strong> This helps us understand app performance across different geographical areas.</li>
            <li><strong>In-app Search History:</strong> We temporarily save your search queries for caching. <strong>Benefit:</strong> This helps us cache results to provide you with faster and more relevant search results on subsequent queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Device and Log Information:</strong> In case of an app error, we collect log data through third-party services. This may include your device’s IP address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics to help us resolve issues.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The app also uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Please review their policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>We are committed to data minimization. All operational data we collect (including your Anonymous User ID, Generalized Location Data, and In-app Search History) is <strong>automatically and permanently deleted from our systems after 90 days.</strong> We only retain this data for the short period needed to improve the app and ensure its stability.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data used as anonymous unique identifiers. This Service does not use "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code that uses "cookies" to collect information. You may have the option to accept or refuse these cookies through your device settings.</p>
        
        <h2>Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites, as we have no control over their content or practices.</p>
        
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and are aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us.</p>
